  <h1>BRIEF HISTORY OF KATSINA</h1>
  <p>Katsina is one of the ancient states in Nigeria, carved from the former Kaduna State, which is located in the northwestern geopolitical zone of the country. It is a state from the ancient kingdoms of the Hausa/Fulani, especially  the two ancient kingdoms of “Katsina and Daura.”</p>
  <p>Katsina State, known to the Hausas as Jihar Katsina, was created in 1987 and borders Kaduna, Zamfara, Kano, and the Jigawa States. History has it that, as one of the earliest kingdoms in Nigeria, Katsina is known as an ancient seat of Islamic culture and learning. Thus, the state was nicknamed the “Home of Hospitality.”</p>
